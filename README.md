A game made by Micha≈Ç Wojtasik(@MWojtasik) and me for "Embeded Systems" project (fifth semester of Applied Computer Science at the AGH University of Science and Technology).
A gameplay and project details are described in projects documentation.
Unfortunately this game was designed to work on microprocessor(LPC 1768) and it requires a specific accelerometer(Pmod ACL). Those requirements makes our game unplayable on PC.
